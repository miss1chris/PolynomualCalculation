# One-variable polynomial calculation based on python
#### The main purpose is to reload the operators in Python,so as to realize the addition, subtraction, multiplication between values and univariate polynomials,     
#### univariate polynomials and univariate polynomials, and the natural power of polynomials.

#### PolynomualCalculation.py：Prepared by the small operation library.
#### main.py：Mainly used for testing and demonstrating the functionality of small libraries
